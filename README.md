"At a homicide rate of approximately 5 per 100,000 population the United States by far has the highest homicide rate among affluent nations. This is a rate that has been fairly stable since 2000." [1]
<br/>
The entangled interplay between crimes and society has always intrigued me, leading me to delve into criminal data and explore the different dynamics of criminal homicides in the US, a nation well known for having one of the highest rates of homicide in the world.
This EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project aims to explore patterns, correlations, and potential socioeconomic implications, promoting a better comprehension of American criminal dynamics.
<br/>
Whithin this project, I explored the following:
- Temporal Trends:
  - How has homicides rate changed over the years ? (2007-2017)
  - Identify yearly/seasonal patterns.
- Geographic Variations:
  - Identify homicides hotspots.
- Socio-economic Analysis:
  - Explore poverty levels in the top 100 lowest income cities/places in the US.
  - Identify the states that appear the most and identify any potential correlation with homicide rates.
- Demographic Analysis:
  - How do victim demographics (age, sex, race) vary across cities and states?
  - Are there any noticeable trends or patterns in victim demographics?
- Intersectional Analysis:
  - How do victim characteristics intersect with each other (e.g., age and race)?
  - Identify subgroups that are more prone to homicides.
- Case Disposition:
  - Explore disposition in different cities/states.
  - Is there any correlation between victim demographics and disposition?
<br/>

This project's aims are as follows:
1. Find suitable, credible and ethical data.
2.  Collect different data types from different resources.
3.  Clean and preprocess CSV and webscraped data properly.
4.  Disect patterns and trends of the data showing that it is viable for further exploration.
5.  Try to identify new and unique correlations in the data.
