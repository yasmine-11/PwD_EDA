"At a homicide rate of approximately 5 per 100,000 population the United States by far has the highest homicide rate among affluent nations. This is a rate that has been fairly stable since 2000." [1]
The entangled interplay between crimes and society has always intrigued me, leading me to delve into criminal data and explore the different dynamics of criminal homicides in the US, a nation well known for having one of the highest rates of homicide in the world.
The analysis aims to explore patterns, correlations, and potential socioeconomic implications, promoting a better comprehension of American criminal dynamics.
