"At a homicide rate of approximately 5 per 100,000 population the United States by far has the highest homicide rate among affluent nations. This is a rate that has been fairly stable since 2000." [1]
<br/>
The entangled interplay between crimes and society has always intrigued me, leading me to delve into criminal data and explore the different dynamics of criminal homicides in the US, a nation well known for having one of the highest rates of homicide in the world.
The analysis aims to explore patterns, correlations, and potential socioeconomic implications, promoting a better comprehension of American criminal dynamics.
<br/>
Whithin this project, I would like to explore the following:
- Temporal Trends:
  - How has homicides rate changed over the years ? (2007-2017)
  - Identify yearly/seasonal patterns.
- Geographic Variations:
  - Identify homicides hotspots.
- Socio-economic Analysis:
  - Explore poverty levels in the top 100 lowest income cities/places in the US.
  - Identify the states that appear the most and identify any potential correlation with homicide rates.
- Demographic Analysis:
  - How do victim demographics (age, sex, race) vary across cities and states?
  - Are there any noticeable trends or patterns in victim demographics?
- Intersectional Analysis:
  - How do victim characteristics intersect with each other (e.g., age and race)?
  - Identify subgroups that are more prone to homicides.
- Case Disposition:
  - Explore disposition in different cities/states.
  - Is there any correlation between victim demographics and disposition?
<br/>
This project aims to:
+ Find suitable, credible and ethical data.
+ Collect different data types from different resources.
+ Clean and preprocess CSV and webscraped data properly.
+ Disect patterns and trends of the data showing that it is viable for further exploration.
+ Try to identify new and unique correlations in the data.
